  <h1>Hello World</h1>


  <table cellspacing="10">

    <td>


      <p>Last week I hit 49 years old and began a new journey to learn to code.
        I was thinking, maybe this old dog can learn a new trick.
        The last time I had a go at coding was thirty-plus years ago. </p>

      <p>It was a coding journey that began on my 13th birthday, in 1983.
        I was standing in an electronics store admiring the range of home computers.
        I remember there being a ZX-81 a ZX spectrum and I think I
        recall an Atari or Commodore.
        My auntie was with me and was going to foot the bill as a birthday treat. </p>


      <p>A young spotty salesperson in an ill-fitting shiny suit approached
        us and began his well-rehearsed pitch, "....with your sort of budget
        I would go for the Oric-1,
        unlike the ZX spectrum it has an easy to use a keyboard." </p>

      <p>The salesperson did a good job because we left the store with the last
        Oric-1 computer on the shelf. It had a massive 16 kilobytes of memory!
        Suit man also sold us a cassette recorder, "you'll need this to
        load your games and save your programmes."
        He also threw in a game called 'Scuba Diver,' on a tape cassette of course.
        The full bundle came to ¬£150; that is ¬£630 in today's money. </p>

      <p>The Oric did not come with a monitor. Getting it home,
        I had to plug the computer into the family's
        only television set, rented from Radio Rentals. I had to schedule my
        'Scuba Diving' adventures around the family's TV viewing habits.</p>



      <p>For me, this was not just a games console. I soon discovered
        I got more fun out of trying programme this strange little machine,
        rather than just using it for collecting underwater pearls while
        avoiding sea urchins. I wanted to be the game creator! A computer
        programmer! Or as they are called it today, a developer!
        However, to realise my ambitions I
        needed even more time hogging our rented TV. The solution was to
        become a night owl, programming in the early hours until the sun came
        up when my mum would want to switch on TV-AM</p>

      <p>I spent many hours each night trying to get the Oric to do what
        I wanted it to. It communicated in a language called (Basic).
        Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. </p>

          <p>During the school summer holidays, I managed to make my own Atari type
            football game. It was very very laggy, or has my 11-year-old daughter
            would say now, "Glitchy!" The ball was made from the capital letter
            'O' and when it hit an object It would briefly turn into the small
            letter 'o' giving the impression it got a little squashed.
            Computer animation! It took six weeks of hard work,
            but I got an amazing sense of achievement seeing
            this letter bounce around the television screen.
            I saved my hard work to an audio cassette, labeled and
            posted to a Software Company in America in the hope they
            might employ me one day. I just had a feeling it might be
            a business worth getting into. </p>

          <p>My coding journey was short-lived. But, I loved it.
            It was also very hard. Finding bugs was tough. You'd just get a simple message
            when the script wouldn't run, "Syntax Error line 20".
            I would end up spending days
            trying to work out what had gone wrong. There was no Google search engine to save
            you back then and the only documentation was the manual that came with the Oric. </p>

          <p>
            Some of my family thought that spending all my hours wrestling with
            this machine was an unhealthy and pointless past-time. I.T lessons at school
            were just terrible and because I am dyslexic, it was a struggle.
            Teachers discouraged me from embarking on a career in computing,
            and so, when my little Oric died a year later, my coding journey came to
            an end too. I never did hear back from the American Software company who had
            the only copy of Daniel's Football Game. Maybe it's still collecting dust in
            a cupboard in Silicon Valley somewhere.

          </p>

          <p>With my computing career over, I took an alternative path that led
            to an amazing television career working as a producer and director. A very different
            world where scripts and programmes have very different meanings. Although, with just
            360 days before I'm 50, I want to go back to my childhood passion and become a
            developer once again.
          </p>

          <p>I never lost my interest in coding, but to be honest,
            I feared going back to it in today's world. Would it be far too hard for me?
            My first computer language- BASIC- is a
            dead language; computers and apps are astronomically
            more sophisticated today. </p>

          <p>What I have discovered in the last week, is that it is so much easier
            to learn to code today. Text editors give you clues about your code and
            there is a wealth of online documentation to help you. There are forums,
            YouTube tutorials. Without sounding too much like an
            old git, kids today don't know how lucky they are! </p>

          <p>I've just started a couple of courses on Udemy -</p>

          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/">
            <p>The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp and iOS 12 & Swift ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è</p>

            </p>
          </a>

          <p>Both these courses are by Angela Yu an excellent teacher who get my full marks. Who knows,
            I might recreate my Atari style football game
            once again or even a Scuba Diving adventure game for the iPhone. </p>
